## üìã Features

-   **Real-Time Sentiment Analysis**: Instantly classifies movie reviews as positive or negative.
-   **Keyword Insights**: Highlights the specific words that most influenced the model's decision.
-   **Efficient ML Model**: Utilizes a highly optimized **SGD Classifier (Logistic Regression)** for fast and accurate predictions.
-   **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Leverages **Optuna** with parallel processing to efficiently find the best model parameters.
-   **Full MLOps Lifecycle**: Tracks experiments, parameters, and metrics using **MLflow**.
-   **Interactive Frontend**: A responsive, single-page application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, featuring a "Dark Mode Cinema" theme and reveal-on-scroll animations.
-   **Containerized Deployment**: Packaged into a production-ready **Docker** image and deployed on **Render**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running Locally

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.9 (recommended to manage with `pyenv`)
-   Docker Desktop

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/AbhiGTM19/Movie-Review-Sentiment-Classifier.git](https://github.com/AbhiGTM19/Movie-Review-Sentiment-Classifier.git)
cd Movie-Review-Sentiment-Classifier
```

### 2. Set Up the Python Environment

It is highly recommended to use the specific Python version this project was built with.

```bash
# Install and set the local Python version using pyenv
pyenv install 3.9.18
pyenv local 3.9.18

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download required NLTK data
python -m nltk.downloader punkt stopwords
```

### 4. Train the Model

This script will run the Optuna tuning process and generate the model files (`movies_review_classifier.pkl` and `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl`) inside a `models/` directory.

```bash
python train.py
```

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
python main.py
```

The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

### 1. Build the Docker Image

The `Dockerfile` is optimized for production. **If you are on an M1/M2 Mac**, you must build for the `linux/amd64` platform to deploy to Render.

```bash
# For M1/M2 Macs (Recommended for deployment)
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t <your-dockerhub-username>/sentiment-scope .

# For other systems
docker build -t <your-dockerhub-username>/sentiment-scope .
```

### 2. Run the Container Locally

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 <your-dockerhub-username>/sentiment-scope
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

### 3. Push to Docker Hub and Deploy

Push the image to Docker Hub and then deploy it on Render by pointing to your public image URL.

```bash
docker push <your-dockerhub-username>/sentiment-scope
```
